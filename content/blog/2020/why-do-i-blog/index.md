I usually answer *Why are you like that* questions — which I get asked
with some frequency, for good or ill — with "I can’t help it. It’s in my
nature." The constant puttering, interspersed with oversharing that
ranges from instructive to awkward? That’s just me. I wouldn’t be me if
I didn’t do that.

But this came across my RSS feed, and it works too.

That’s true too. There are ways to putter and rant besides blogging. I
could have a YouTube channel. But this is what I know how to do.

Thank goodness.
