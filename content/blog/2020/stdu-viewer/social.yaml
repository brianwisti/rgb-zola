      We're using aluminum wire because it won't rust and it's not magnetic (ok around MRIs) but twist ties and pipe cleaners work ok too.

      I knit the mask, <a href="https://twitter.com/IamMrsGeek">@IamMrsGeek</a> sews in a lining layer for inside.

      Less about protecting ourselves and more about reducing risk of asymptomatic spread even a little bit (since other people have greater need of the *good* masks).

      at any given time). Does STDU Viewer restore your session?</p>
