Been meaning to get [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention)
integration for a *while*. Went the easy way, using
[webmention.io](https://webmention.io) and [brid.gy](https://brid.gy).
Easier than writing everything myself.

For now itâ€™s just like counts, with a [Invoke](/tags/pyinvoke) task
checking my mentions feed at Hugo build time. More stuff is planned, but
first I decide how much information to show and from which sources. Not
every tweet reply is intended as a blog comment.
