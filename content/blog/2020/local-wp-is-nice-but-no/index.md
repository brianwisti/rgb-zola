Playing with an instance of [WordPress][] on my computer by way of [Local][] and I'm at a loss.
What's that big friendly-looking thing with the unobtrusive buttons?
Where are the 150 things I need to remember for a single post?

Well, they're probably in the part where I'd need to make sure everything is up to date.
With the static site once it's up I don't have to care about it any more.

My brain hurts.

Only â€” you know.
Smaller.
Not so intimidating.

Nah, I'll stick with my overcomplicated [site][] workflow for now.
