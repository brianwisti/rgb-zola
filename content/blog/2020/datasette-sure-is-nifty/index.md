So uh yeah. See I was stumbling my way through using
[sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.readthedocs.io) to collect site
content metadata. Finally figured that out but then made the mistake of
looking at that data through
[Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io).

Okay not really a mistake. Helped me find a few dozen front matter
typos. [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/) makes cool stuff.
