      Ah, yes, the long tail.   The Pull Request Challenge created a lot of Pull Requests, which caused uploads by authors that otherwise probably wouldn't have.  So you could argue that still a small number of people are responsible for a major part of the uploads.

      I did notice that there's a pretty long tail, which I found reassuring. We definitely got a few heavy releasers, but they weren't the only ones showing up.

      I'm pretty sure you will see an uptick in number of uploads since the lockdown started.  You should probably also take a look at number of uploads / author: there is at least one uploader that used to be responsible for ~40% of uploads in the past years, if I recall correctly.
