So I used to have another site.
I also used to have a Yahoo email account.
The domain name was registered under a Network Solutions account using the Yahoo account.
All was well for years.
<!--more-->

Except that all was not well.
The Yahoo account was frequently compromised.
I still can't figure out whether to blame Yahoo or myself for that.
Spam was sent from my account to contacts on a regular basis.
I got fed up in 2011 and deleted the email account.
I forgot about the Network Solutions hookup, though.
The old site - coolnamehere.com - expired in May 2013 and went to some sort of auction thing.
I decided to set up a new site rather than fuss with the auction.

Random Geekery is the same thing that coolnamehere was:
a mix of notes and tutorials about geeky code stuff along with occasional personal updates.
Unlike the old site, I'm starting out with a blog and enabling comments.

The old coolnamehere content will be uploaded here so that sites which link to its resources will still have something to point to.
I'll make a note when that happens.
