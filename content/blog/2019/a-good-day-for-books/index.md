Decided I wanted a copy of "[Learning Perl 6][]" before it becomes "Learning [Raku][]".
I give my bookshelf room for nostalgia.

[Learning Perl 6]: https://www.learningperl6.com/
[Raku]: http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2019/10/larry-has-approved-renaming-perl-6-to-raku.html

And of *course* I needed a physical copy of the 20th Anniversary [Pragmatic Programmer][].
