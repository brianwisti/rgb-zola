Outlining a post about my [notes][]. Learned that [_why][] coined [tumblelog][],
which is sort of what the notes are. And then I wanted to make this note.
With the foxes. But I couldn't find a nice big version. So I made a nice big
version. It's [Attribution-ShareAlike][], just like the original. You can use
it.
