[Celtic Art: The Methods of Construction]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/618205.Celtic_Art

This started with practicing a knotwork pattern from [Celtic Art: The Methods of
Construction][], and ended up as an exercise in how long I could add stuff
before I got bored. Thirteen hours. Not bad.

Not in a row, of course.

[The Tangles of Kells]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26311641-the-tangles-of-kells

Oh and I threw in a couple tangle elements from [The Tangles of Kells][].

I might be ready to try drawing things on purpose again. Usually itâ€™s just that
my hands get itchy when I see blank space.
