Took me six months to make these. Itâ€™s a good thing she likes them!

## The pattern

Using [Sensational Knitted Socks][sock-book] by Charlene Schurch, as usual.
Been a while since I knitted any socks, so I went with a safe [moss
stitch][moss-stitch] fallback.

## The yarn

brand
: Think Bamboo

style
: B917

color
: 992

composition
: 45% bamboo, 40% wool, 15% nylon

site
: https://thinkbamboo.com; doesn't work for me at the moment

The yarn is pretty, and works nice once you get going.  It is beyond a hassle
to wind up, though.
