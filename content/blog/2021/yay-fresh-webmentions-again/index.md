[Webmentions]: https://webmention.io
[Bridgy]: https://brid.gy/

Finally reconnected the site flow bits that grab and file fresh [Webmentions][].
Probably going to tweak rendering of the [Bridgy][] bits that feed reactions
from bigger social networks. It's that or add threading *here* for conversation
that happens *there*.
No thank you.

Anyways yay!
