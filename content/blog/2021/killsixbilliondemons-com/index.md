From the [About][] page:

> Q: What is this all about?
> 
> This is a webcomic!
> It’s graphic novel style, meaning it’s meant to be read in large chunks, but you can subject yourself to the agony of reading it a couple pages a week!

Been reading it a few years now.
It's h*ckin' glorious is what it is.
