[Terence Martin][terence-martin] posted a couple helpful videos [explaining][]
version licensing and the impending changes to the [Sublime Text][sublime-text]
text editor, along with some tips on [getting started][getting-started] with
"version 4." So nice I watched them twice.

A real subscription, where you get to keep the builds you paid for.  I like
this.

Okay, sure.  Sublime Text isn’t open source.  Version releases are few and far
between. But it’s *good* — the only graphical text editor I’ve used that feels
as responsive as [Vim][vim].

I love supporting independent development when I can.  A subscription approach
is more sustainable for developers and more satisfying for users than the
(extremely) intermittent bursts of version-based licensing.  There’s nothing
official, so I don’t know what’s really happening.  The [Sublime
Discord][sublime-discord] "announcements" channel holds the details.

Python 3.8.6. Good stuff!
