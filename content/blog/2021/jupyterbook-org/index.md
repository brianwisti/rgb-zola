[Jupyter]: https://jupyter.org/
[MyST Markdown]: https://jupyterbook.org/content/myst.html

The notebook server approach of [Jupyter][] has been a great exploratory tool at work.
Still not sure about *writing* with it though.

[reStructuredText]: /tags/rst

On the other hand, [MyST Markdown][] ­
Markdown extensions modeled after reStructuredText][] ­
looks very interesting indeed.
Then Jupyter executes the code blocks while building.

Wonder if I could make a blog as a Jupyter book?
