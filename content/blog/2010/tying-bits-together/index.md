I'm working on tying together the blog and my site. A little [JQuery][] magic
expands the RSS feed of this blog for visitors to [coolnamehere][]. I'll
improve the integration over time, probably by adjusting the template used
for the blog. Meanwhile, I have more incentive to use Blogger.

<p>I'll probably add feeds from other services to the site, such as <a href="http://www.google.com/profiles/brian.wisti#buzz">Buzz </a>or <a href="http://twitter.com/brianwisti">Twitter</a>. I use those frequently, and they are great for the short thoughts that don't belong in either a blog post or a static page.</p>
