I automatically share new posts on [Mastodon][mastodon] and [Twitter][twitter].
[Atom][atom-def] is the best way to follow this site, though. It works even
when my announcement scripts don’t.

An Atom file summarizes recent updates on a site. Feed reader apps, such as
[Feedly][feedly] (web), [Newsflow][newsflow] (Windows),
[FeedReader][feed-reader] (Linux), or [NetNewsWire][nnw] (macOS), let you
subscribe to all the sites you like, letting you read updates on your own
schedule.

Subscribe to the Random Geekery blog by copying and pasting one of the
below links — the link itself, not the xml file you see if you click the
link — into your feed reader app!

[main-feed]: /atom.xml
[post-feed]: /category/post/atom.xml
[posts]: /category/post/
[notes-feed]: /category/note/atom.xml
[notes]: /category/note/

- the [main feed][main-feed] includes everything on the site, including my
  experiments with new non-post categories
- the [post feed][post-feed] focuses on (generally) longer [posts][posts] about
  code, craft, and assorted thoughts
- the [notes feed][notes-feed] holds only my [notes][notes]: small posts,
  informal, more frequent than full blog bosts
