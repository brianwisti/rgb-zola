About a year ago we moved to [Federal Way][], a suburb between Seattle and
Tacoma. After twenty years in the city, I'm still adjusting to back yards and
no coffee shop across the street. Work is writing [Python][] for [Pandemic Response Labs][prl].

There is a page [about][] me and the site if you want general information.

What about more specifically?

- we got cats, but if you follow me on Twitter you probably already know this
- cleaning up the site to get it where I can more easily try building it with
  different [Jamstack](https://jamstack.com) frameworks.
- Working. A lot. Which is better than some of the alternatives, but still. At least it's a fun project.
- Been [married][] almost two years!
