I have made one or two of my own tools that Iâ€™m fairly proud of. Okay,
one. [PageTemplate](/post/2002/06/pagetemplate/) is a kinda nifty
[Ruby](/tags/ruby) templating tool which I use for my CGI work with
Ruby.

I have ideas for more stuff, but most of those ideas are just floating
around in limbo waiting for me to pin them down.
