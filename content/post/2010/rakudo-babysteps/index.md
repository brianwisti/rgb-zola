I want to learn [Rakudo][]. You *might* want to learn Rakudo.
Let's spend a little time looking at how to get started. While I follow the same very simple pattern of
other Babysteps on this site, I don't expect Rakudo to be your first language. I won't spend as much time
explaining what's going on, at least not on my first pass through these steps.
