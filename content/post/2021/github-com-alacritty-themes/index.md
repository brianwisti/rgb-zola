Bookmarked because hey it works in Alacritty for Windows too! I haven’t tried
it in WSL or anything. I just ran it from the PowerShell prompt via `npx`.

    PS > npx alacritty-themes

Might seem frivolous to some folks but now I can easily use a high-contrast
theme when the sun’s right in my face every morning and something softer at
night.
