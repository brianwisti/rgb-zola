[Roam Research]: https://roamresearch.com
[Obsidian.md]: https://obsidian.md
[Org]: /tags/orgmode

A lot like [Roam Research], or so I'm told.
Haven't tried Roam myself.

Similar to [Obsidian.md], though Logseq's graph isn't quite so pretty yet.
It stores your notes in local files, in Markdown — or [Org]! — formats.

## The cool stuff

[Taskwarrior]: /tags/taskwarrior

- link to files or individual nodes
- lightweight task management; much less complex than Org or [Taskwarrior], but more than just checkbox lists
- properties for complex structures
- template support
- shortcodes (embedding YouTube videos, stuff like that)
- query logic `{{query (todo now)}}` to see everything you told yourself you're currently doing
- in active development; bug fixes and feature improvements seem regular

## The cautions

* app defaults to browser view, but editing local files is apparently unsupported in Firefox
* limited customization of the app interface; those may be Org files, but this ain't Org mode
* in active development; expect breakage, changes in functionality, and placeholders for documentation

- Loqseq's own [overview]
- [OneStutteringMind]'s ongoing series of tutorial videos;
  makes the app approachable; pretty much the only reason I'm trying Logseq out
- the [Awesome Logseq] list of resources is kind of a correction to my initial note about limited customization;
  you can do more than I thought from my day or two clicking around in the app
