I just wanted to see if I can do it without [vim-orgmode].
I can.
Sort of.
Using [Vimwiki] with [TaskWiki] for Taskwarrior integration.
Not appearing in this image: [vim-table-mode].
Appearing but not relevant to the Org-ish experiment is [vim-which-key].
Completely missing: any sort of [Babel] code evaluation/tangling.

That agenda-ish task list is *real* cool but needs to show more info, like tags.
