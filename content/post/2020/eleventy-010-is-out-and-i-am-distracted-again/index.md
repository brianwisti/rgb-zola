Making note of this

I love that there are so many great static site generators out. I hate
that I don’t have enough time to try *all* of them.

But [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev) has the possum logo. Hard to argue with
that. Maybe I’ll revisit with the [base
blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) template, or one of
the other [starter kits](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/starter/). The [deep
dive](/post/2019/04/eleventy) idea was a little ambitious, anyways.
