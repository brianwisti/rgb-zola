So I still love my [Datasette](https://datasette.readthedocs.io)
dashboard.
But — [Mastodon::Client](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mastodon::Client)
with a variation on [fREW’s
`q`](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/hugo-unix-vim-integration/#advanced-unix-tools)
script I mentioned [the other
day](/post/2020/05/querying-hugo-content-with-python)? Works real good.
Fast.

Good night.
