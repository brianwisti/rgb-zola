      What this will be about what and why.

      Effilicious is about all things which are efficient and delicious, but not necessarily at the same time. You will find here methods to do this and that as well as recipes for cooking. This about covers the What.
      Why? L’art pour l’art and maybe more.

I’ll write a post about this some day.
      So there it is. I’ll try to IndieWeb this site using KEVQ’s guide and keep comments coming in this way. If you want to comment, well, set up a web site and do it in this IndieWeb way or write me an email.

      <h4>I wanted to utilise the IndieWeb to take ownership of my data and to make may site more connected. This post talks about how I’ve managed to do that.</h4><p>This website has been Webmention enabled for quite some time, but having a 4-day weekend here in the UK this weekend, I decided to spend some time hacking on this site to add more IndieWeb functionality.</p><h2>Indie-what now?</h2><p><em>IndieWeb!</em> You never heard of it? Basically it’s a way of using your own website as your entire gateway to the Internet.

      I wanted to utilise the IndieWeb to take ownership of my data and to make may site more connected. This post talks about how I’ve managed to do that.This website has been Webmention enabled for quite some time, but having a 4-day weekend here in the UK this weekend, I decided to spend some time hacking on this site to add more IndieWeb functionality.Indie-what now?IndieWeb! You never heard of it? Basically it’s a way of using your own website as your entire gateway to the Internet. The essence of the whole thing is to post once, then choose where it’s shared from there.If you want to learn more about why you think about should implementing the IndieWeb (IW) into your site, take a look at their documentation.
      There are many reasons why you should use the IndieWeb, from controlling your experience on the web (instead of corporate algorithms), to deciding where and when to post your content and where it goes.
      The IndieWeb
      I’ve talked about why you should own your own domain, but using the services that the IW offers, you can take that to the next level. That’s what I’ve now done with this site.H-CardA h-card is basically a very small profile about yourself with some links. It tells the IW what information about you should be considered a single source of truth.A h-card can be as detailed, or a high-level as you like. There are a tonne of elements you can use in your h-card, but you can use as few or as many as you want. My h-card can be found on the homepage of this site:
