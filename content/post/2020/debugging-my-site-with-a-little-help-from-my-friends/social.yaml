      <p>
      I hear from Brian that <a class="u-in-reply-to" href="https://randomgeekery.org/note/2020/05/debugging-my-site-with-a-little-help-from-my-friends/">I didn't properly mark up a note yesterday with any author information</a>. I am happy that this helped him with his own projects even though I feel slightly embarrassed about it. I hope that this note fares better.
      </p>

      <p>I am at present hand-writing these notes, in naked HTML, like it's 1995. But I want to get into the practice of using jmac.org - which I consider my real personal domain, versus fogknife.com, which is a publication that I emit - and doing so according to indieweb principles.</p>

      <p>If I waited until I had the perfect toolchain for it, then I'd never start. Better to <em>just start typing</em> now, and see where my impatience carries me.</p>
