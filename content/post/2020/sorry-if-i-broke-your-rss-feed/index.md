But hey I got my permalinks where I wanted them, without needing a UUID
after all. Took a bit of juggling to get the Hugo
[aliases](https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#aliases) and my
support data synced up. You folks got the
[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org) — JavaScript, APIs, Markup — for your
static sites. I got — uh, guess I got the "Damstack" — Database, APIs,
Markup — for *my* static site.
