<a href="http://jquery.com/">JQuery</a>'s my favorite JavaScript library by a long shot (very straightforward approach to manipulating page elements), and the <a href="http://ui.jquery.com/">JQuery UI</a> makes it even better (so much shiny). I'm looking forward to using it in future projects.

Sadly, I need to hunker down at work and get back to my <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/">YUI</a> stuff. YUI's nice, but it is a lot more complex than JQuery. I'm still trying to figure out if it's worth the extra overhead, or if I'm missing some way to make things easier.
