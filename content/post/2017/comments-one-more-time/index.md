Trying to add Disqus comments once again. I adjusted permalinks, since the old
`/:section/:year/:title/` structure seemed to confuse Disqus. Here’s hoping. I
assigned aliases to content so that old links should work.

I know. I’m fickle about comments. I want them, then I don’t want them. I’d
switch to WordPress but I’d have to untangle all the Hugo specifics that I’ve
adopted over the last couple years.

Oh heck a week from now marks [two years][] since I switched to Hugo. Either it
got easier to use or I got used to it. And every time I’m ready to look
elsewhere they add something new.
