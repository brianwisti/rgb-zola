tl;dr: check out <https://randomgeekery.online>

Decided to start putting my raw notes online.
Okay not *raw* raw.
Still gonna be some filtering for content.
But ye gods it is raw in the sense of being very rough.

I set up a new [Dendron][dendron] vault, used [Astro][astro] to build a site from it, and [Netlify][netlify] to host the site.
Netlify is synced up to the repo.
Since [GitDoc][git-doc] is enabled to commit and push every minute, my brain should stay fresh with minimal effort on my part.

That seems like a good thing, generally.
