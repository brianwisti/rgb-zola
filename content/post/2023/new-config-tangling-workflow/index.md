I had to refresh my [config][config] pages.
I had to refresh how my config is generated.
Why not do both at the same time?

So now I've got [Yarner][yarner] tangling Markdown sources for the whole thing.
Even the [dotbot config][dotbot-config].

Sometimes I go too far.
Doesn't mean I'll stop.

[config]: /config/
[yarner]: https://mlange-42.github.io/yarner/
[dotbot-config]: /config/install.conf.yaml.md/
