I've got a pretty nice flow here. It's easy to make quick posts and have a mini blog along with the lengthy stuff - whenever I get around to those.

Naturally, I'm thinking about changing everything again.

I love my static blogs too much. It would take some work to approach the convenience of what I have now. Maybe run my site build script as a daemon, watching for changes in a Dropbox folder. Add a note-taking app for the phone that saves to Dropbox, and I'm all set.

Just a simple matter of coding.
