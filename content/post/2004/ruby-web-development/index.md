As much as I admire the clever braintwistings of FreeRide and the many
other excellent projects that are out there, I must admit that Web
programming is what I know best. And Web programming is what this
section is about, from the Ruby side of things. I will take a peek at
CGI programming, Embedded Ruby, setting up servers, and anything else I
can think of that will make it easier for you to use Ruby as a major
component of developing your Web applications.
