Nice work! You have begun to learn Perl by writing a complete program which
gets input from a user and prints output including a modified version of their
input. Yes, there is much more to learn, but you have dipped your toes 
into the pool. Now you can go out there and start learning about the 
huge and wild world of Perl programming!

### Additional Resources

Here are a few links to resources that you can use while learning about Perl
and how to use it for your own nefarious purposes.

* <http://learn.perl.org>
* <http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Tutorials>
* <http://www.perl.com/>
* <http://perl.oreilly.com/>
* <http://perldoc.perl.org/>

There are a *lot* more, but I can't recall many of the links right
now. I may put them up as time goes on.
