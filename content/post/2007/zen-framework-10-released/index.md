<a href="/tags/php/">PHP</a> may not be my favorite language, but the last couple of years have seen profound improvement. I got the urge to start playing with <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework</a> last week. It isn't too shabby. Yesterday Zend made a <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/2262-Zend-Framework-1.0.0-production-release">1.0 release</a>, which is a good milestone for PHP types to learn about MVC and ACLs etc. You know, other than the ones who are already using <a href="http://cakephp.org/">CakePHP</a>. You're probably doing just fine.

Oh, and I've been messing about with <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a> as well. It doesn't feel as comfortable as <a href="http://simpletest.org/">SimpleTest</a>, but I would be willing to use it in my everyday unit testing.
