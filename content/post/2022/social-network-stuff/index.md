The toilet fire that is Twitter's new management strategy continues apace.
Felt compelled to take my normally wide-open account and lock it.
I don't want to deactivate and delete.
Somebody else can come along, grab the name, and spam the hell out of people with it.

But hey, where else can you find me?
I'll update my h-card once the dust settles, but here's where I'm at roughly in order of how much attention I've given it:

- [Mastodon][mastodon]
- [Cohost][cohost]
- [Tumblr][tumblr]
- [Pillowfort][pillowfort]

[mastodon]: https://hackers.town/@randomgeek
[cohost]: https://cohost.org/randomgeek
[tumblr]: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/randomgeekery
[pillowfort]: https://www.pillowfort.social/randomgeek

Meanwhile I'm pondering the plausibility of a single-user [Fediverse][fediverse] instance as a way to enable comments.
Or I could just set up a WordPress site.
Until I decide on that, you can find me at one or more of the listed sites.

[fediverse]: https://fediverse.party

And all this is kinda depressing after 15 years on Twitter.
Okay yes I hated it half the time but that uh that came from a place of love.
But anyways enough gloominess.
How about a picture of one of the cats?
