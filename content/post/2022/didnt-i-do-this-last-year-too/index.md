So anyways yeah. Site's built with [Hugo][hugo] again. This iteration is
relatively minimal: let Hugo be Hugo with Markdown, render hooks, and
shortcodes. A justfile. Some Python for preprocessing and tests. Right, and
`markdownlint-cli`. I'd love to do posts about some or all of the pieces.
Meanwhile, there's always the [repo][repo].

[Notes][notes] and [bookmarks][bookmarks] got merged into the main post stream.
Internal links are clean, but no promises yet about links from the outside
world. That's a pretty big shuffle I just did.

I won't pretend this is the site's final form or anything.

Why? Needed something very fast and reasonably flexible for some other site
experiments in mind. More on those later hopefully.

## Cat-sitting?

Yeah. One of our kitties — Jack — has been having trouble keeping his food down
for a few days. We had better luck with soft food today, but he still threw up
  a little. Let him sleep it off wherever he likes, and check periodically to
  make sure he's breathing. He's eating less than usual, but at least he's
  still eating.

Got a vet appointment for Friday, and a 24-hour emergency vet that said to
bring him down if he gets traumatically worse.
