Thanks to Twitter turbulence, folks are rediscovering the joys of blogging.
I've got a blog --- this site right here --- so I thought I'd try a
[tumblelog][tumblelog] instead. Mixing Org mode journaling and ox-hugo for the
next evolution of this site's Notes experiment.

There will be more to say about it later when I get home from vacation. For
now, just look and enjoy my attempts to amuse myself:
