Been wanting to list at least some of the sites I follow. Blog discovery is
almost as hard as finding a six month old tweet. [Recent events][techdirt-musk]
add some urgency to the thought.

So [this][neighborhood] is me doing my part to help. Right now it's just a
slightly tweaked export of my [Fraidycat][fraidycat] feed, fed into a Hugo
[data template][hugo-data].
