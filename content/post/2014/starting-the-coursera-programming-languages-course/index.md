I signed up for the [Programming Languages][] course by
[Coursera][]. I may even complete it. See, I signed up for a Scala
course earlier this year, but did not get past the first
video. That made me sad. Scala is one of those things that I
would like to learn.

*Many* topics appeal to me. This causes problems. I will never
stop finding things that I want to learn: languages, idioms,
platforms, databases, security, and so on. The list becomes almost
frightening when you add non-computery things that I want to get
better at: drawing, knitting, cooking, writing, etcetera.

I keep trying to learn new things. I know that I will never have
enough time to learn most of it, but I keep trying.

Preparation makes more things possible. You are supposed to set time
aside that is just for focused learning. The early morning and early
evening work best for me, since there are fewer distractions.

Some of my preparation involves watching videos with the express purpose of
learning. [Avdi Grimm][]'s [Ruby Tapas][] episodes help with that goal.
They are short. They are educational. They are fun.

The Coursera videos have a greater length than Ruby Tapas, of
course. At least my brain is warmed up for the task of focused
learning. A few stretching exercises have been done.

I'm nervous. My habits are getting better, but my ratio of Things
Started to Things Finished embarrasses me. I will not make "Finish
This Course" a requirement. Too nervous. But I will have a certain
amount of pride if I can make it through, do the assignments, and
maybe even - *gasp* - turn them in.

Here's hoping.
