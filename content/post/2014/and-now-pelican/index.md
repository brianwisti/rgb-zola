I’m not sure why, but I wasn’t *quite* comfortable with
[o-blog](https://github.com/renard/o-blog). It works well enough, but
decided it was time to poke around with [jekyll](/tags/jekyll) again.

Used [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) to convert the older
WordPress posts to Markdown. Discovered that I like how Emacs handles
Markdown files more than Vim. Contemplated drinking heavily to readjust
my world view, decided against it.

Even so, I kept bumping into issues with Jekyll - that can happen with
opinionated software. Gave [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) a try,
and turns out Pelican was exactly what I was looking for.

For now.
